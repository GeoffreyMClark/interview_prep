# Machine Learning / Robotics Interview Prep
This file is a compilation of interview prep for Geoffrey Clark covering a range of topics including: statistics, math, machine learning, optimization, and deep neural networks. There will obviously be some overlap in these categories however I will endevor to do my best to sort each question into a usefull section. For each question I add an explanation and math/code if applicable. Please let me know if you have any questions or additional questions you would like me to add.
